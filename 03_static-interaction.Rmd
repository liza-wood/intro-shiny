# Static interaction 

So far, our dashboard doesn't have any content -- we only have boxes and some text. What we want to do next is add in a figure so that we can work towards interactivity. Our first focus will be on plots that can be interacted with using wrapper functions like `plotly` and `networkD3`, but aren't actually dynamic -- meaning they don't respond to the user yet.

For instance, you might want to just show off some graphs and let folks have a peek at the underlying data, but not actually change the shape or variables represented in the data. Here are some examples: 

* https://testing-apps.shinyapps.io/flexdashboard-dygraphs/
* https://testing-apps.shinyapps.io/flexdashboard-highcharter/

Note that there are loads of examples, all of which share source code (!), available through [`flexdashboard`](https://rstudio.github.io/flexdashboard/articles/examples.html).  

To add in figures we can insert code chunks to our Rmd. As in other Rmd formatting, we can also insert a setup chunk where we load in our packages. Feel free to paste in all of this code to your Rmd document again, or paste only the new code chunk.

### Relationship between penguin bill length and depth
  
```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#51127C") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length (mm)", y = "Depth (mm)") 
```
````

If we click **Knit** again, now we have a plot embedded in our dashboard. Cool! But we can't do anything with it yet -- it is totally static. The first entry point to making this interactive is to use wrapper functions. For instance, you may have played with the [`plotly` package](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R) before. We can wrap the function `ggplotly` around our ggplot to convert the static ggplot to an intractive one, where we can explore the values behind each data point. 

````{verbatim}
```{r}
ggplotly(ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#51127C") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length (mm)", y = "Depth (mm)"))
```
````

Further, `plotly` has lots of capacities, and just one example is that we can play around with the `tooltip` argument in `ggplotly` to adjust what users see. 

````{verbatim}
```{r}
ggplotly(ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#51127C") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length (mm)", y = "Depth (mm)"),
  tooltip = c("x"))
```
````

There are other interactive packages like `plotly`, namely `leaflet` for maps and `networkD3` for networks. You don't necessarily need to follow along here, but for example, we can manipulate the penguins data a little to make a network figure that we can aslo drag and drop around (though admittedly it is a lame network). 

````{verbatim}
### Penguins by island
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  cbind(select(penguins_raw, `Individual ID`)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  select(`Individual ID`, island, species) %>% 
  networkD3::simpleNetwork(        
        charge = -5,  
        fontSize = 8,   
        fontFamily = "Times",      
        linkColour = "#666",        
        nodeColour = "#51127C", 
        opacity = 0.9,            
        zoom = T    
        )
```
````
Now, what we've done so far is cool -- using just flexdashboard and something like `plotly`, you can build this out and make pretty nice semi-static pages.  

For example, below I show a screenshot of a dashboard, aftering playing around with the 'row' formatting of `flexdashboard`, adding in some text and images and figures.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "100%", fig.pos = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/static.png")
```

### The data {data-width=700}

The Palmer Station penguins data is a tidy data set related to three species of Antarctic penguins from Horst, Hill, and Gorman (2020). The data contains size measurements for male and female adult foraging AdÃ©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica between 2007-2009. Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program. You can read more about the package [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html).

But, we haven't really gotten into the dynamic user-interface, which is the main focus of the lesson. (And because of this, note that we haven't even gotten into the world of Shiny yet!) So, that's what's next...
