# Overview {-}

This lesson is meant to be a _cursory_ look at creating interactive dashboards using RMarkdown + `flexdashboard` with Shiny integration. Roughly we will...

1. Introduce and discuss interactive sites (5 minutes)
2. Overview of `flexdashboard` and its layout scheme (10)
3. Create a dashboard with static interaction (does not rely on Shiny) (10)
4. Create a dashboard with dynamic interaction (does rely on Shiny) (30)
5. Themes and styles (5)
6. Publishing (10)

**A note on Shiny:** The focus of this lesson is integrating elements of Shiny through the RMarkdown interface, which is _different_ than learning Shiny outright. is among the more popular ways of creating interactive sites because it provides a server on which you can host for free (up to a limit). So it is a popular starting point, though ...

Shiny can be coded in R in (what I understand) are two main ways. One that relies on the coder's ability to design the architecture through scripting in R and X, where you create the user interface, the server, a web app that links them. A second option relies on the flexdashboard package, which makes dashboard creation through RMarkdown much easier on several fronts, including Shiny. This lesson is going to focus on the latter.

## Set up

### Package installation 

It will be useful to make sure the following packages are installed, especially if your computer is sometimes buggy downloading packages.

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('palmerpenguins')
install.packages('plotly')
install.packages('flexdashboard')
# worry less about...
install.packages('networkD3')
```


### shinyapps.io account 

If you want to actually publish the page we make in this lesson, you will need to create a Shiny account and link it to your RStudio. To do this, please complete the following steps: 

1. [create a Shiny account](https://login.shinyapps.io/login?redirect=%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3Drstudio-shinyapps%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.shinyapps.io%252Fauth%252Foauth%252Ftoken%26response_type%3Dcode%26scopes%3D%252A%26show_auth%3D0) 
2. Follow the instructions for publishing in RStudio by navigating to **Tools** > **Global Options** > **Publishing**. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/publishing.png')
```

Once on this pane, you'll click **Connect** > **shinyapps.io** and follow the instructions to link your account. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.show="hold", out.width=c("48%", "48%")}
knitr::include_graphics(c('img/shinypath.png','img/instructions.png'))
```
