# Overview {-}

This lesson is meant to be a _cursory_ look at creating interactive dashboards using RMarkdown + `flexdashboard` with Shiny integration. Roughly we will...

1. Introduce and discuss interactive sites  
2. Overview of `flexdashboard` and its layout scheme  
3. Create a dashboard with static interaction (does not rely on Shiny)  
4. Create a dashboard with dynamic interaction (does rely on Shiny)  
5. Discuss options for themes and styles 
6. Publish the site 

**A note on Shiny:** The focus of this lesson is integrating elements of Shiny through the RMarkdown interface via `flexdashboard`, which is _different_ than learning classic Shiny via the `shiny` package. More standard tutorials for learning Shiny, such as [Posit's introduction](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html), can show you how to build an app without `flexdashboard`. Personally, I think learning Shiny via `flexdashboard` is a good gateway, as it introduces some (but not all) of the concepts needed for more advanced app-building.

## Set up {-}

### Package installation {-}

It will be useful to make sure the following packages are installed, especially if your computer is sometimes buggy downloading packages.

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('palmerpenguins')
install.packages('plotly')
install.packages('flexdashboard')
install.packages('shiny')
# worry less about...
install.packages('networkD3')
```


### Make a shinyapps.io account {-}

If you want to actually publish the page we make in this lesson, you will need to create a Shiny account and link it to your RStudio. To do this, please complete the following steps: 

1. [create a Shiny account](https://login.shinyapps.io/login?redirect=%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3Drstudio-shinyapps%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.shinyapps.io%252Fauth%252Foauth%252Ftoken%26response_type%3Dcode%26scopes%3D%252A%26show_auth%3D0) 
2. Follow the instructions for publishing in RStudio by navigating to **Tools** > **Global Options** > **Publishing**. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/publishing.png')
```

Once on this pane, you'll click **Connect** > **shinyapps.io** and follow the instructions to link your account. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.show="hold", out.width=c("48%", "48%")}
knitr::include_graphics(c('img/shinypath.png','img/instructions.png'))
```

### Review conditionals  
This is not essential, but one of the trickiest parts of making documents interactive is setting the right conditionals for re-shaping your data. I would recommend revisiting the logic behind **conditional statements** in R, which include `if...else`, `ifelse()`, and `case_when()` functions. This tutorial will use the `if...else` syntax, so maybe worth [brushing up on](https://www.guru99.com/r-if-else-elif-statement.html).
